# Gold-Price-Prediction:

# 📈 Gold Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project aims to predict gold prices using Simple Linear Regression. It explores the relationship between macroeconomic variables (e.g., crude oil price) and gold prices.

## 🎯 Problem Statement (Using STAR Method)

**S – Situation:**  
Gold prices are influenced by many factors such as crude oil prices, USD exchange rates, and inflation. Accurately predicting these prices is crucial for investors and financial analysts.

**T – Task:**  
Develop a simple yet effective predictive model to forecast gold prices using historical economic data.

**A – Action:**  
- Collected and cleaned historical gold price data with economic indicators.
- Explored data through visualizations and correlation analysis.
- Built and trained a Simple Linear Regression model using scikit-learn.
- Evaluated performance using metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² Score.
- Visualized predicted vs. actual gold prices.

**R – Result:**  
Achieved an R² Score of **X.XX**, demonstrating a strong linear relationship. Established a reproducible workflow for future forecasting and baseline comparison with complex models.
